As a software engineer, you are probably always working on exciting and challenging projects that showcase your skills and abilities. A portfolio page is a great way to showcase your work and highlight your achievements to potential employers, clients, and colleagues. It's a way to demonstrate your expertise and give people a glimpse into your technical capabilities. Plus, it's a great way to reflect on your past work and see how far you've come in your career. So don't be shy - go ahead and create a portfolio page and show the world what you can do!

# Let's hit the ground running!

Welcome to the exciting world of web software development! If you're reading this, it means you're ready to dive into our project and start building something amazing.

Before you get started, here are a few things to keep in mind:

## Plan ahead

Make sure you have a clear idea of what you want to build and how you're going to build it. This will help you stay on track and avoid getting bogged down in the details.

## Take breaks

Building software can be mentally and emotionally draining, so it's important to take breaks and give yourself time to recharge. Step away from the screen every once in awhile and do something that helps you relax and refocus.

## Don't be afraid to ask for help

Software development can be challenging, but you don't have to go it alone. Don't be afraid to reach out to your team or the community for help and advice.

## Have fun

Above all, remember that building software is supposed to be fun! Don't get too caught up in the stress and pressure - enjoy the process and see where your creativity takes you.

Alright, now that you're ready to roll, it's time to get started! Happy coding!

# The collaboration contraption

Attention, fellow developers! Are you ready to take your skills to the next level and join the ranks of the tech elite? Then you'll need to get yourself set up on some key platforms.

First up, we have [GitHub](https://github.com/). This is where you'll be able to share your code with the world, collaborate with other developers, and keep track of your projects. It's a must-have for any serious coder.

Next, we have [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). This is the go-to place for asking and answering technical questions. It's a great way to learn from others and share your own knowledge.

[Loom](https://www.loom.com/) is a useful tool for creating and sharing screen recordings, so you can easily communicate and collaborate with your team.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a powerful design tool that's perfect for creating and sharing user interfaces and other design assets.

[WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/dashboard) is a handy tool that tracks your activity in your code editor and provides insights into your productivity. Plus, it's super easy to use and integrates seamlessly with your favorite code editor.

And last but not least, there's [Discord](https://discord.com/). This is a great platform for chatting with your team, sharing files, and staying organized.

So go ahead and create accounts on these platforms - trust us, you'll be glad you did!

# Geek Central Station

As a software engineer, your development environment is your digital workspace - it's where you do your best work and bring your brilliant ideas to life! Whether you're coding up a storm, debugging with precision, or testing out new features, your development environment plays a crucial role in your workflow and productivity.

Think of your development environment as the foundation of your software engineering career. Without a solid foundation, your work will be unstable and prone to cracks and collapses. But with a well-crafted development environment, you'll be able to build with confidence and create amazing things!

So don't skimp on your development environment - invest in the tools, configurations, and setup that work best for you. Your future self (and your teacher/boss) will thank you for it.

Let's get this show on the road! Follow these simple steps to get started:

1.  [Unix-style Shell](docs/shell.md)
2.  [Node Version Manager](docs/nvm.md)
3.  [Git](docs/git.md)
4.  [VS Code](docs/vscode.md)

# The wizardry behind the curtain

We're excited to share with you the tools and technologies we used to bring this project to life.

First up, we have [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs). This powerful CSS framework helped us style our interface with ease, using a flexible and customizable set of utility classes. It was like a box of building blocks for our design needs.

Next up, we have [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/). This lightweight JavaScript library added interactivity and dynamism to our interface, making it come alive with smooth transitions and responsive elements. It was like a pinch of magic dust for our user experience.

Together, Tailwind CSS and AlpineJS made a formidable team, helping us create a beautiful and functional interface that delights our users. We hope you enjoy using it!

# The secret sauce of great code

We take code standards seriously around here - so seriously, in fact, that we have a whole team of [Code Heroes](/docs/code-standards.md) dedicated to sniffing out bad code and helping it reach its full potential.

Code is like a good book - it should always be easy to read, understand, and enjoy. Okay, maybe not exactly like a good book, but you get the idea. When code is easy to read, understand, and maintain, it makes the development process smoother and more efficient. Imagine trying to read a book that was written in a foreign language, with no punctuation, and with random words and letters scattered throughout. Not exactly a pleasant experience, right? The same goes for code - when it's messy and hard to follow, it can be frustrating and time-consuming to work with. That's why code should always be easy to read, understand, and maintain - it just makes life (and coding) better for everyone involved.
