# Husky

Husky is a tool that can be used with Git to automate tasks related to version control. It is designed to work as a Git hook manager, which means that it can be used to run tasks before or after specific Git events, such as committing code or pushing changes to a remote repository.

Some common tasks that Husky can be used for include:

Linting code: Husky can be configured to run a linter, such as ESLint or JSHint, before committing code, to ensure that the code adheres to certain standards and best practices.

Running tests: Husky can be configured to run automated tests, such as unit tests or integration tests, before committing code, to ensure that the code is working as expected.

Updating documentation: Husky can be configured to update documentation or other files before committing code, to ensure that the documentation stays up to date with the codebase.
