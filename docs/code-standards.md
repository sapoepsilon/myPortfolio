# The Code Heroes

Welcome to the world of code heroes! In this section, we'll introduce you to some player who are dedicated to enforcing code standards and keeping your codebase in top form.

Meet [Husky Git Hooks](/docs/husky.md), the code enforcer! This handy tool works as a Git hook manager, running tasks before or after specific Git events to help keep your code clean and tidy. Whether it's linting code, running tests, or updating documentation, Husky for Git has got you covered.

Next up is [ESLint](/docs/eslint.md), the code detective! This powerful linter helps to catch syntax errors and other issues before they become problems, ensuring that your code adheres to standards and best practices. With ESLint on your side, you can be confident that your code is always up to snuff.

[Prettier](/docs/prettier.md) is the code stylist! This handy tool helps to keep your code consistent and easy to read by automatically formatting it according to a set of predefined rules. Whether you're working on a solo project or collaborating with a team, Prettier has got your back

And finally, there's [EditorConfig](/docs/editorconfig.md), the code diplomat! This tool helps to ensure that your codebase has a consistent style and formatting, even when multiple developers are working on it. With EditorConfig on your side, you can say goodbye to style disagreements and hello to happy collaboration!

Remember that investing in code standards is like investing in a good pair of socks for your feet - it might not seem like a big deal at first, but it can make a huge difference in the long run!

Here are a few reasons why investing in code standards is important:

1. Code standards help to keep your codebase clean and tidy, just like a good pair of socks keeps your feet clean and comfortable.
2. Code standards help to make your code easier to read and understand, just like a good pair of socks makes it easier to walk and move around.
3. Code standards help to prevent bugs and other issues, just like a good pair of socks helps to prevent blisters and other foot problems.
4. Code standards make it easier to collaborate with other developers, just like a good pair of socks makes it easier to share shoes with your friends.
